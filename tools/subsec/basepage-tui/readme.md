A minimal, text-focused terminal dashboard and feed reader. It aggregates your favorite subreddits, standard RSS, and Atom feeds into a single lightweight, keyboard-driven interface.

Designed to run completely sandboxed in your alternate screen buffer to keep your primary terminal scrollback clean.

## Features

* **Universal Feed Parser**: Supports Reddit subreddits, standard Atom (like GitHub Releases), and RSS 2.0 (like Hacker News) out of the box.
* **Interactive Scan Filter**: Real-time keyword scanner that dynamically highlights matches across feed titles, snippets, and deep text reader buffers with full backspace recovery.
* **Global & Local Match Counters**: Instantly aggregates keyword frequency across cached datasets on the index page, and shifts to localized frequency maps while scrolling long documents.
* **Auto-Discovery Private Redirects**: Automatically fetches, verifies, and routes Reddit links through active [Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib) private front-end instances to prevent trackable redirects.
* **Alternate Screen Sandboxing**: Runs inside the terminal's alternate screen buffer (`?1049h`), leaving your terminal exactly as it was when you exit.
* **Hacker News Integration**: Intercepts HN selections to immediately open the native discussion thread in your default browser instead of blank self-text pages.
* **Background Sync**: Launches an invisible background worker on boot to pre-cache your feeds and sorting states, keeping the UI fast.
* **Dynamic Menu & Configuration**: Customize and scale your dashboard simply by adding new entries to a single configuration dictionary inside the script.

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements
* **Python 3.11+**
* An internet connection (for initial feed fetching and Redlib instance validation).

### 2. Installation
Clone this repository or download the script directly:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/local-ai/tools/subsec/basepage-tui/
wget -O ~/.config/local-ai/tools/subsec/basepage-tui/basepage.py [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/basepage/main/basepage.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/basepage/main/basepage.py)
chmod +x ~/.config/local-ai/tools/subsec/basepage-tui/basepage.py

```

### 3. Usage

Run the script to launch the dashboard:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/local-ai/tools/subsec/basepage-tui/basepage.py

```

## Adding Custom Feeds

You can add any RSS, Atom, or Reddit feed by modifying the `FEEDS` dictionary at the top of the `basepage.py` script:

```python
FEEDS = {
    "r/hyprland": {"type": "reddit", "subreddit": "hyprland"},
    "r/unixporn": {"type": "reddit", "subreddit": "unixporn"},
    "Hacker News": {"type": "custom", "url": "[https://news.ycombinator.com/rss](https://news.ycombinator.com/rss)"},
    "llama.cpp Releases": {"type": "github", "owner": "ggml-org", "repo": "llama.cpp"}
}

```
